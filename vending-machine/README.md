# Vending Machine

You are developing a vending machine. Your component deals with monetary
exchange. A user deposits money into the vending machine, selects a product, and
the product is provided along with proper change.

Proper change is defined as using the largest denominations possible using
American coinage. If the change is 86 cents, the output will be 3 quarters, 1
dime, and 1 penny.

Once your submissions is ready, open a pull request as normal and schedule time
with a TA to go over your code.
